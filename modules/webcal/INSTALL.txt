1. Install webcalendar somewhere where it will be accessible below the path
   of you Drupal install. E.g. if your drupal site is accessible at
   "www.mysite.com/drupal/" webcalendar would have to be installed at
   "www.mysite.com/drupal/webcal/". This is due to restrictions browsers place
   on reading cookies.
   If possible install the webcal tables in the same database as the drupal
   tables.

2. Copy the webcal folder into your modules directory

3. Enable the module in drupal

4. Configure the webcal module in Drupal:
   administer->settings->webcal

5. Set the permissions for accesing webcal in Drupal:
   access webcal = user can view public calendar
   administer webcal = user can change the webcal settings in drupal
                       (eg path to webcal, iframe properties)
   login to webcal = user has they're own calendar
   webcal admin = user is a webcal admin

6. a) If you are using WebCalendar 1.1.x:
   Copy login-app.php into your webcalendar root directory (overwrite the
   existing file) & rename user-app-drupal-1.1.x.php to user-app-drupal.php
   and copy into your webcalendar ./includes directory.

   b) If you are using WebCalendar 1.0.x:
   Rename user-app-drupal-1.0.x.php to user-app-drupal.php and copy into your
   webcalendar ./includes directory.

7. Edit the settings in the config section at the top of user-app-drupal.php

8. Edit ./includes/settings.php in the webcalendar directory and change the
   user_inc line to "user_inc: user-app-drupal.php" (without the quotes)

9. Click the calendar link on your menu and you should see webcalendar
