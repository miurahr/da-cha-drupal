6/20/04

- Fix for URL changes in hook_help().

6/18/04
- Updated for today's hook_menu() and "local tasks" patch.

6/17/04
- Restored truncating behavior for the teaser. Now every field is run through
  node_teaser() before being inserted in the teaser, so <!--break--> can be used
  if desired.
- Merged in some of Gerhard's changes to the image module, which will hopefully
  fix image upload problems.
- Fixed names of "add" menu items (again).

6/16/04
- Field types are now scanned automatically inside the modules/flexinode folder.
- Separated displayed names of field types from the file names.
- "Description" field deprecated; instead, use a text area field. This
  allows the field to be reordered or removed entirely.
- Added a database updating function. Run this to upgrade from old versions.
- Default values of text areas can now span multiple lines.
- "Read More" link shows up again like it used to.
- Drupal indexed search should work now, since the body now contains the
  rendered node.
- Administrator can determine which fields show up in the teaser.

- Added taxonomy selection form to node edit page.

2/13/04
- Finished include file migration.

2/10/04
- Migrated more code into the includes.
- Added custom search forms. Searches can be narrowed by any field that is
  a checkbox or dropdown. Date ranges should be added in the future. Go to
  flexinode/search/1 to try the search (where 1 is the content type ID).

2/9/04
- Split code into several include files. This task is not complete, but
  now that the files exist updates in the future will be easier.
- Small change to the new DB schema that allows files to be sorted
  correctly. I now believe the schema to be future-proof, and will attempt
  to support upgrade paths from now on.

2/8/04
- Resurrected the table view for content types. Go to flexinode/table/1 to
  view it (where 1 is the content type ID). This now has a column for
  every non-textarea field; the limit of four columns no longer applies.

2/6/04
- Brand new DB schema, which may allow bringing back the table view in a
  cleaner fashion, and also allow for custom searches ala project.module.
- Fixed file and image removal during node updates.
- Released in contributions repository.
- Changed dropdown storage to use numbers rather than text (will make
  sorting friendlier later).

1/12/04
- Added file/image support using new file API.
- Updated for pager include changes.
- Cleaned up checkbox output.
- Added support for date/time fields.

12/8/03

10/13/03
- "Read More" link is now forced when viewing teasers.
- Updated for changes to menu/help system.
- First pass at providing help text.
- Split _admin into separate functions to reduce calls to arg().
- New "list" page mode.
- Body is now properly filtered before output.

10/6/03
- Squelched some "empty array" warnings.
- Updated module for "path" patch to CVS.
- Fixed table pager.

  any custom fields.

9/29/03
- User can now specify descriptions for fields.
- Updated to work with "integrated admin menu" patch to CVS.
- Now relies on "many node types, one module" patch in for_review.
  Because of this, the interface is cleaner, and taxonomy vocabularies
  can be assigned to individual content types rather than to all
  flexinode types.

9/24/03
- Initial version.
