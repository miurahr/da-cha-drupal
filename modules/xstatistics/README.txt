Description:
------------
Xstatistics is a module meant for extendibility. It offers basic
statistics summaries at the moment, but any features are welcome for
review. Think about SVG diagrams, graphics, Search-engine referrer
analyzing (what were they looking for), path-reports and other
interesting reports.

NOTE: You must enable the core "statistics" module and enable the
"Count Content Views" to get the full value out of this package.
