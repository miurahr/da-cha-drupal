Installing filemanager for Drupal 4.7.* requires that you visit the 
administer->modules page:

  http://yoursite?q=admin/modules
  
When you enable the filemanager module, the requisite database table will
be created for you.

Important Notes:
This module does create directories and may have problems in some restricted
or odd user configurations.  Please make sure your PHP configuration creates
folders with permissions for the PHP user to add new files.  In addition
depending on your PHP configuration you may be forced to have both the private
and public directories underneath your base directory.  If so be sure to
restrict access to the private files through .htaccess

If you are having problems with file not found errors, please try using absolute
paths to your file locations.  Some PHP environments don't properly resolve
relative filenames for the realpath and file_exists function.  This seems to
be caused when realpath or file_exists have to resolve symbolic links.
