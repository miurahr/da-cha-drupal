INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR trackback

(1) Download the tarball to your 'modules' directory

(2) Extract the tarball with

      "tar -xvzf trackback-4.x.y.tar.gz"

    where the 'x' and 'y' should be the digits that
    are in the exact name of the tarball you've downloaded.

(3) There is a file called trackback.mysql.  You need to
    feed this to your mysql:

      ON THE COMMAND-LINE
      mysql -u user -p password < trackback.mysql

(4) Once you have done this, log in to your Drupal
    site as someone with permission to enable modules
    and enable trackback.

(5) To configure trackback, go to, in the out-of-the-box
    navigation scheme: 'administer->trackbacks' and
    click on the 'configure' tab.
