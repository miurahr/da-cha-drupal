msgid "The trackback module allows users to give a blog post a contextual link to another. A context is made because the trackbacking poster is, in theory, writing about something mentioned on another blogger's trackbacked post.  Using the trackback URL accompanying each post, another website can send a ping to your website. Once received, the trackback will show up on the trackback page accompanying the post.  It also includes auto-discovery, spam moderation queues, and the ability to manually ping another site."

#: trackback.module:11
msgid "If trackback autodisovery is enabled on your website, someone need only visit your post via a link from another website post to have trackback <em>discover</em> the linking site and create the trackback. Trackback auto-discovery also works internally within a website, automatically creating connections between pages which link to each other. To manually send a ping to another site, edit your post and use the trackback URL field at the bottom of the edit page to submit the trackback URL for the post on the other site. Once you enter submit, your website will ping the other site for you. With trackback autodiscovery enabled, your site will attempt to do this automatically without your intervention."

If a URL accepts trackbacks, trackback will ping the trackback URL found on that page if one has been posted at that URL.<br>*note: This has the potential to take a very long time depending on the amount of links you have in your posts. Using the 'Run auto-detection on cron' option delays the most time consuming part of the process to when cron is run on the site. This speeds perfomance when editing and creating content, but delays trackbacks until cron is run."
