INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPGRADING:

(1) Get the latest trackback.module file from CVS.

(2) Perform your regular Drupal upgrade as you would by going
    to http://example.com/update.php where "example.com/" should
    be the domain (and path if applicable) of your Drupal site.

(3) After doing the standard core Drupal database update in (2),
    copy the trackback_upgrade.php file, to the root
    directory of your Drupal installation (i.e., the same directory
    as your index.php file).

(4) Now, to run the trackback_upgrade script, point
    your browser to http://example.com/trackback_upgrade.php.

(5) If something doesn't seem to work, complain:
