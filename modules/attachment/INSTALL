Installation
------------
Before installing this module you should already have the filemanager module
installed and configured.  This module requires an additional table to store
attachment information.  I have supplied scripts for creating a mysql table.
This table can be created using following command:

mysql -u {userid} -p {drupaldatabase} < attachment.mysql

Once the table is created copy the attachment.module into your drupal
installation's modules directory.  You should then disable the upload module
and enable the attachments module.  You will then give the appropraite user roles
the 'add attachments' permission.  Finally you will need to enable the attachment
capability under the content types configuration pages.

Themes
------
This modules introduces a new theme hook of _attachments.  This hook should
format a listing of the attachments for a give node.
