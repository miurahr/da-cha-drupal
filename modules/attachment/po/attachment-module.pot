First the user is checked to make sure they have <em>add attachments</em> permission.  These permissions can be set on the <a href=\"%permissionurl%\">permissions</a> page.  Second attachments must be enabled for that particular node type.  You can enable nodes on the <a href=\"%nodeconfigurl%\">default workfow</a> page.</p>"
