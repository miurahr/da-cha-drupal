INSTALLATION:

Let's do the easy stuff first. Copy the article directory into
your Drupal modules/ directory.  Login as administrator and click on
the administer link to enter your admin interface.

Once there, navigate to administer -> modules menu.  You should now see the
article module listed. Enable this module by clicking the box next
to it and save your configuration via the button at the bottom of
the page.

Next goto the settings -> article menu.

The most important setting here is the "Article Vocabularies" section. The
vocabularies that you select here will determine which categories and nodes
will be displayed on the articles index page.

Once you have associated a vocabulary with the Article module you should be
ready to use it. If you already had nodes in the associated vocabularies then
they should already show up in the article index. If you do not have nodes then
add a couple to test out the module.
